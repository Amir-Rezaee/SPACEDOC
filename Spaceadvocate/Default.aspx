                <p>Organisations are challenging the effectiveness of their workplace accommodation and
its impact to the bottom line. The emergence Covid-19 and its impact on workplace health
and safety, coupled with advanced technologies supporting work from home (WFH) and
more flexible remote working are driving many businesses to assess what they really need,
what their staff want, and how to use their workspace to enhance profitability rather than
be treated as a cost centre. </p>
                <p class="blue bold">The workspace of the future will be vastly different to that of today.
Space requirements will vary - some will shrink, some will grow, but all will re-invent.</p>
